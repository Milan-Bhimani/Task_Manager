# KEY DIFFERENCES FROM ORIGINAL ROADMAP

| Original Roadmap | Revised Roadmap |
|------------------|-----------------|
| 5-6 months learning only | 6 months to GET JOB |
| Deep ML theory first | ML deployment first, theory later |
| No job focus | Job-focused from day 1 |
| Linear path | Two-phase approach |
| Pure AI/ML end goal | Backend → AI/ML transition |

---

# THE HONEST TRUTH

1. **You need money first** - Job provides stability to learn properly
2. **Learning while earning** - Most successful engineers did this
3. **2 years to ML transition** - This is realistic, not 6 months
4. **Your FastAPI skills are valuable** - Don't abandon them
5. **AI-Enhanced Developer NOW** - Pure ML Engineer LATER
